						DevAsk is a community of coders built for all levels of techies. We
						thought of how most front end developers get stuck trying to
						identify a bug on a line of code thus wasting productive time.
						Thatâ€™s why we came up with a community that allows other front end
						developers in the space to look through your code and debug in the
						shortest time possible.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our product helps people find answers they need, whenever they need
						it. We help empower people by giving them a platform for them to
						feel accomplished and have a fun time. People ask questions, get
						replies and people also get paid, All in one platform.
